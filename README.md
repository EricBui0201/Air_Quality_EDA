# Air_Quality_EDA

**1. Introduction**

***Dataset***

The dataset has been downloaded from the https://aqicn.org/ for the period from 1.1.2019 to 17.9.2020.
The website is developed by The World Air Quality Index team project, a non-profit project started in 2007.
The air quality information is provided for more than 130 countries, covering more than 30,000 stations in 2000 major cities.
All the Air Quality data seen on World Air Quality Index are the official data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) each country.

***Objective***
The general objective of this project is to explore the insights of the air quality in 16 cities within the periode from January 2019 to July 2020.

By analyzing the data of this sample, we are going to answer the following questions:
  * What is the change in the (median) AQI from 2019 to 2020? (of all cities / per city)?
  * What are the correlations between the indices of weather and the (median) AQI?(of all cities / per city)
  * Did the (covid19) lockdown have an impact on the air quality of all and each city?
